# Marketing Insights on Amazon Retail and Locker Expansion

Working at InMarket as a data scientist, I collaborated with the Chief Marketing Officer to increase our company mentions on major publications. We saw an opportunity with Amazon's launch of AmazonGo, Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, and Amazon's exapansion of their lockers. Using InMarket's proprietary first party location data, I evaluated foot traffic patterns that led to journal articles written with my analysis.
